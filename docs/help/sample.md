## Description [↩](#nav)

Randomly samples CSV data.

It supports eight sampling methods:  
* RESERVOIR: the default sampling method when NO INDEX is present and no sampling method
is specified. Visits every CSV record exactly once, using MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
sample size (k) - O(k).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling>

* INDEXED: the default sampling method when an INDEX is present and no sampling method
is specified. Uses random I/O to sample efficiently, as it only visits records selected
by random indexing, using MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the sample size (k) - O(k).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access>

* BERNOULLI: the sampling method when the --bernoulli option is specified.
Each record has an independent probability p of being selected, where p is
specified by the <sample-size> argument. For example, if p=0.1, then each record
has a 10% chance of being selected, regardless of the other records. The final
sample size is random and follows a binomial distribution. Uses CONSTANT MEMORY - O(1).
When sampling from a remote URL, processes the file in chunks without downloading it
entirely, making it especially efficient for sampling large remote files.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_sampling>

* SYSTEMATIC: the sampling method when the --systematic option is specified.
Selects every nth record from the input, where n is the integer part of <sample-size>
and the fraction part is the percentage of the population to sample.
For example, if <sample-size> is 10.5, it will select every 10th record and 50% of the
population. If <sample-size> is a whole number (no fractional part), it will select
every nth record for the whole population. Uses CONSTANT memory - O(1). The starting
point can be specified as "random" or "first". Useful for time series data or when you
want evenly spaced samples.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_sampling>

* STRATIFIED: the sampling method when the --stratified option is specified.
Stratifies the population by the specified column and then samples from each stratum.
Particularly useful when a population has distinct subgroups (strata) that are
heterogeneous within but homogeneous between in terms of the variable of interest.
For example, if you want to sample 1,000 records from a population of 100,000 across the US,
you can stratify the population by US state and then sample 20 records from each stratum.
This will ensure that you have a representative sample from each of the 50 states.
The sample size must be a whole number. Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
number of strata (s) and samples per stratum (k) as specified by <sample-size> - O(s*k).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling>

* WEIGHTED: the sampling method when the --weighted option is specified.
Samples records with probabilities proportional to values in a specified weight column.
Records with higher weights are more likely to be selected. For example, if you have
sales data and want to sample transactions weighted by revenue, high-value transactions
will have a higher chance of being included. Non-numeric weights are treated as zero.
The weights are automatically normalized using the maximum weight in the dataset.
Specify the desired sample size with <sample-size>. Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
sample size (k) - O(k).
"Weighted random sampling with a reservoir" <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2005.11.003>

* CLUSTER: the sampling method when the --cluster option is specified.
Samples entire groups of records together based on a cluster identifier column.
The number of clusters is specified by the <sample-size> argument.
Useful when records are naturally grouped (e.g., by household, neighborhood, etc.).
For example, if you have records grouped by neighborhood and specify a sample size of 10,
it will randomly select 10 neighborhoods and include ALL records from those neighborhoods
in the output. This ensures that natural groupings in the data are preserved.
Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the number of clusters (c) - O(c).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling>

* TIMESERIES: the sampling method when the --timeseries option is specified.
Samples records based on time intervals from a time-series dataset. Groups records by
time windows (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) and selects one record per interval.
Supports adaptive sampling (e.g., prefer business hours or weekends) and aggregation
(e.g., mean, sum, min, max) within each interval. The starting point can be "first"
(earliest), "last" (most recent), or "random". Particularly useful for time-series data
where simple row-based sampling would always return the same records due to sorting.
Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the number of records - O(n).

Supports sampling from CSVs on remote URLs. Note that the entire file is downloaded first
to a temporary file before sampling begins for all sampling methods except Bernoulli, which
streams the file as it samples it, stopping when the desired sample size is reached or the
end of the file is reached.

Sampling from stdin is also supported for all sampling methods, copying stdin to a in-memory
buffer first before sampling begins.

If a stats cache is available, it will be used to do extra checks on systematic,
weighted and cluster sampling, and to speed up sampling in general.

This command is intended to provide a means to sample from a CSV data set that
is too big to fit into memory (for example, for use with commands like
'qsv stats' with the '--everything' option).

## Arguments [↩](#nav)

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argument&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| &nbsp;`<input>`&nbsp; | The CSV file to sample. This can be a local file, stdin, or a URL (http and https schemes supported). |
| &nbsp;`<sample-size>`&nbsp; | When using INDEXED, RESERVOIR or WEIGHTED sampling, the sample size. Can either be a whole number or a value between value between 0 and 1. If a fraction, specifies the sample size as a percentage of the population. (e.g. 0.15 - 15 percent of the CSV) When using BERNOULLI sampling, the probability of selecting each record (between 0 and 1). When using SYSTEMATIC sampling, the integer part is the interval between records to sample & the fractional part is the percentage of the population to sample. When there is no fractional part, it will select every nth record for the entire population. When using STRATIFIED sampling, the stratum sample size. When using CLUSTER sampling, the number of clusters. When using TIMESERIES sampling, the interval number (treated as hours by default, e.g., 1 = 1 hour). Use --ts-interval for custom intervals like "1d" (daily), "1w" (weekly), "1m" (monthly), "1y" (yearly), etc. |
