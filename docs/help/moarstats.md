## Description [↩](#nav)

Add dozens of additional statistics, including extended outlier, robust & bivariate
statistics to an existing stats CSV file. It also maps the field type to the most specific
W3C XML Schema Definition (XSD) datatype (<https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/>).

The `moarstats` command extends an existing stats CSV file (created by the `stats` command)
by computing "moar" (<https://www.dictionary.com/culture/slang/moar>) statistics that can be
derived from existing stats columns and by scanning the original CSV file.

It looks for the `<FILESTEM>.stats.csv` file for a given CSV input. If the stats CSV file
does not exist, it will first run the `stats` command with configurable options to establish
the baseline stats, to which it will add more stats columns.

If the `.stats.csv` file is found, it will skip running stats and just append the additional
stats columns.

Currently computes the following 25 additional univariate statistics:  
1. Pearson's Second Skewness Coefficient: 3 * (mean - median) / stddev
Measures asymmetry of the distribution.
Positive values indicate right skew, negative values indicate left skew.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness>
2. Range to Standard Deviation Ratio: range / stddev
Normalizes the spread of data.
Higher values indicate more extreme outliers relative to the variability.
3. Quartile Coefficient of Dispersion: (Q3 - Q1) / (Q3 + Q1)
Measures relative variability using quartiles.
Useful for comparing dispersion across different scales.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile_coefficient_of_dispersion>
4. Z-Score of Mode: (mode - mean) / stddev
Indicates how typical the mode is relative to the distribution.
Values near 0 suggest the mode is near the mean.
5. Relative Standard Error: sem / mean
Measures precision of the mean estimate relative to its magnitude.
Lower values indicate more reliable estimates.
6. Z-Score of Min: (min - mean) / stddev
Shows how extreme the minimum value is.
Large negative values indicate outliers or heavy left tail.
7. Z-Score of Max: (max - mean) / stddev
Shows how extreme the maximum value is.
Large positive values indicate outliers or heavy right tail.
8. Median-to-Mean Ratio: median / mean
Indicates skewness direction.
Ratio < 1 suggests right skew, > 1 suggests left skew, = 1 suggests symmetry.
9. IQR-to-Range Ratio: iqr / range
Measures concentration of data.
Higher values (closer to 1) indicate more data concentrated in the middle 50%.
10. MAD-to-StdDev Ratio: mad / stddev
Compares robust vs non-robust spread measures.
Higher values suggest presence of outliers affecting stddev.
11. Trimean: (Q1 + 2*median + Q3) / 4
Tukey's trimean - a robust estimator of central tendency combining the median
with the midhinge. More robust than mean, more efficient than median alone.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimean>
12. Midhinge: (Q1 + Q3) / 2
Midpoint of the middle 50% of data. A robust central tendency measure
that complements the mean and median.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhinge>
13. Robust CV: MAD / |median|
Robust Coefficient of Variation using MAD and the magnitude of the median.
Always non-negative. Resistant to outliers, useful for comparing variability.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_measures_of_scale>
14. Kurtosis: Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution (excess kurtosis).
Positive values indicate heavy tails, negative values indicate light tails.
Values near 0 indicate a normal distribution.
Requires --advanced flag.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis>
15. Bimodality Coefficient: Measures whether a distribution has two modes (peaks) or is unimodal.
BC < 0.555 indicates unimodal, BC >= 0.555 indicates bimodal/multimodal.
Computed as (skewness² + 1) / (kurtosis + 3).
Requires --advanced flag (needs skewness from base stats and kurtosis from --advanced flag).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodality>
16. Jarque-Bera Test: (n/6) * (S² + K²/4)
Standard test for normality using skewness and kurtosis.
Also computes jarque_bera_pvalue (from chi-squared distribution with 2 df).
Low p-values (< 0.05) indicate the data is NOT normally distributed.
Requires --advanced flag (needs kurtosis).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarque%E2%80%93Bera_test>
17. Gini Coefficient: Measures inequality/dispersion in the distribution.
Values range from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality).
Requires --advanced flag.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient>
18. Atkinson Index: Measures inequality in the distribution with a sensitivity parameter.
Values range from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (maximum inequality).
The Atkinson Index is a more general form of the Gini coefficient that allows for
different sensitivity to inequality. Sensitivity is configurable via --epsilon.
Requires --advanced flag.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_index>
19. Theil Index: (1/n) * Σ((x_i / mean) * ln(x_i / mean))
Measures inequality/concentration. Unlike Gini, it is decomposable into
within-group and between-group components. Only computed for positive values.
Requires --advanced flag.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil_index>
20. Mean Absolute Deviation (from mean): (1/n) * Σ|x_i - mean|
Average absolute distance from the mean. Different from MAD (which uses median).
Less robust but more statistically efficient than MAD.
Requires --advanced flag.
21. Shannon Entropy: Measures the information content/uncertainty in the distribution.
Higher values indicate more diversity, lower values indicate more concentration.
Values range from 0 (all values identical) to log2(n) where n is the number of unique values.
Requires --advanced flag.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>
22. Normalized Entropy: Normalized version of Shannon Entropy scaled to [0, 1].
Values range from 0 (all values identical) to 1 (all values equally distributed).
Computed as shannon_entropy / log2(cardinality).
Requires shannon_entropy (from --advanced flag) and cardinality (from base stats).
23. Simpson's Diversity Index: 1 - Σ(p_i²)
Probability that two randomly chosen values are different.
Ranges from 0 (all identical) to 1 (all unique). More intuitive than entropy.
Requires --advanced flag (computed alongside entropy from frequency data).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Simpson_index>
24. Winsorized Mean: Replaces values below/above thresholds with threshold values, then computes mean.
All values are included in the calculation, but extreme values are capped at thresholds.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorized_mean>
Also computes: winsorized_stddev, winsorized_variance, winsorized_cv, winsorized_range,
and winsorized_stddev_ratio (winsorized_stddev / overall_stddev).
25. Trimmed Mean: Excludes values outside thresholds, then computes mean.
Only values within thresholds are included in the calculation.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean>
Also computes: trimmed_stddev, trimmed_variance, trimmed_cv, trimmed_range,
and trimmed_stddev_ratio (trimmed_stddev / overall_stddev).
By default, uses Q1 and Q3 as thresholds (25% winsorization/trimming).
With --use-percentiles, uses configurable percentiles (e.g., 5th/95th) as thresholds
with --pct-thresholds.

In addition, it computes the following univariate outlier statistics (24 outlier statistics total).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier>
(requires --quartiles or --everything in stats):  

Outlier Counts (7 statistics):  
- outliers_extreme_lower_cnt: Count of values below the lower outer fence
- outliers_mild_lower_cnt: Count of values between lower outer and inner fences
- outliers_normal_cnt: Count of values between inner fences (non-outliers)
- outliers_mild_upper_cnt: Count of values between upper inner and outer fences
- outliers_extreme_upper_cnt: Count of values above the upper outer fence
- outliers_total_cnt: Total count of all outliers (sum of extreme and mild outliers)
- outliers_percentage: Percentage of values that are outliers

Outlier Descriptive Statistics (6 statistics):  
- outliers_mean: Mean value of outliers
- non_outliers_mean: Mean value of non-outliers
- outliers_to_normal_mean_ratio: Ratio of outlier mean to non-outlier mean
- outliers_min: Minimum value among outliers
- outliers_max: Maximum value among outliers
- outliers_range: Range of outlier values (max - min)

Outlier Variance/Spread Statistics (7 statistics):  
- outliers_stddev: Standard deviation of outlier values
- outliers_variance: Variance of outlier values
- non_outliers_stddev: Standard deviation of non-outlier values
- non_outliers_variance: Variance of non-outlier values
- outliers_cv: Coefficient of variation for outliers (stddev / mean)
- non_outliers_cv: Coefficient of variation for non-outliers (stddev / mean)
- outliers_normal_stddev_ratio: Ratio of outlier stddev to non-outlier stddev

Outlier Impact Statistics (2 statistics):  
- outlier_impact: Difference between overall mean and non-outlier mean
- outlier_impact_ratio: Relative impact (outlier_impact / non_outlier_mean)

Outlier Boundary Statistics (2 statistics):  
- lower_outer_fence_zscore: Z-score of the lower outer fence boundary
- upper_outer_fence_zscore: Z-score of the upper outer fence boundary

These outlier statistics require reading the original CSV file and comparing each
value against the fence thresholds.
Fences are computed using the IQR method:  
inner fences at Q1/Q3 ± 1.5*IQR, outer fences at Q1/Q3 ± 3.0*IQR.

These univariate statistics are only computed for numeric and date/datetime columns
where the required base univariate statistics (mean, median, stddev, etc.) are available.
Univariate outlier statistics additionally require that quartiles (and thus fences) were
computed when generating the stats CSV.
Winsorized/trimmed means require either Q1/Q3 or percentiles to be available.
Kurtosis, Gini & Atkinson Index require reading the original CSV file to collect
all values for computation.

BIVARIATE STATISTICS:  

The `moarstats` command also computes the following 6 bivariate statistics:  
1. Pearson's correlation
Measures linear correlation between two numeric/date fields.
Values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation).
0 indicates no linear correlation.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient>
2. Spearman's rank correlation
Measures monotonic correlation between two numeric/date fields.
Values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation).
0 indicates no monotonic correlation.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient>
3. Kendall's tau
Measures monotonic correlation between two numeric/date fields.
Values range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation).
0 indicates no monotonic correlation.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient>
4. Covariance
Measures the linear relationship between two numeric/date fields.
Values range from negative infinity to positive infinity.
0 indicates no linear relationship.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance>
5. Mutual Information
Measures the amount of information obtained about one field by observing another.
Values range from 0 (independent) to positive infinity.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information>
6. Normalized Mutual Information
Normalized version of mutual information, scaled by the geometric mean of individual entropies.
Values range from 0 (independent) to 1 (perfectly dependent).
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information#Normalized_variants>

These bivariate statistics are computed when the `--bivariate` flag is used
and require an indexed CSV file (index will be auto-created if missing).
Bivariate statistics are output to a separate file: `<FILESTEM>.stats.bivariate.csv`.

Bivariate statistics require reading the entire CSV file and are computationally VERY expensive.
For large files (>= 10k records), parallel chunked processing is used when an index is available.
For smaller files or when no index exists, sequential processing is used.

MULTI-DATASET BIVARIATE STATISTICS:  

When using the `--join-inputs` flag, multiple datasets can be joined internally before
computing bivariate statistics. This allows analyzing bivariate statistics across datasets
that share common join keys. The joined dataset is saved as a temporary file that is
automatically deleted after computing the bivariate statistics.
The bivariate statistics are saved to `<FILESTEM>.stats.bivariate.joined.csv`.

Non-finite numeric tokens ("NaN", "Infinity", "-Infinity", and their case variants) are
excluded from moarstats computations — the parser in moarstats filters them out before they
reach correlation, variance and mean calculations, preventing a single bad cell from silently
poisoning the results. Note that the baseline `stats` command may still count these tokens
as Float observations, so the `type`/`null_count` columns in `<FILESTEM>.stats.csv` are not
affected by this filter.
