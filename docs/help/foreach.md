## Description [↩](#nav)

Execute a shell command once per record in a given CSV file.

NOTE: Windows users are recommended to use Git Bash as their terminal when
running this command. Download it from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>. When installing,
be sure to select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" to ensure that the
necessary Unix tools are available in the terminal.

WARNING: This command can be dangerous. Be careful when using it with
untrusted input.

Or per @thadguidry: 😉
Please ensure when using foreach to use trusted arguments, variables, scripts, etc.
If you don't do due diligence and blindly use untrusted parts... foreach can indeed
become a footgun and possibly fry your computer, eat your lunch, and expose an entire
datacenter to a cancerous virus in your unvetted batch file you grabbed from some
stranger on the internet that runs...FOR EACH LINE in your CSV file. GASP!"

## Examples [↩](#nav)

Delete all files whose filenames are listed in the filename column:  
```console
qsv foreach filename 'rm {}' assets.csv
```

Execute a command that outputs CSV once per record without repeating headers:  
```console
qsv foreach query --unify 'search --year 2020 {}' queries.csv > results.csv
```

Same as above but with an additional column containing the current value:  
```console
qsv foreach query -u -c from_query 'search {}' queries.csv > results.csv
```

For more examples, see [tests](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/tests/test_foreach.rs).

If any child command exits with a non-zero status, foreach finishes processing
all rows but then exits with a non-zero status of its own.

## Foreach Options [↩](#nav)

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| &nbsp;`‑u,`<br>`‑‑unify`&nbsp; | flag | If the output of the executed command is a CSV, unify the result by skipping headers on each subsequent command. Does not work when --dry-run is true. The first child's CSV header row becomes canonical; later children are expected to produce the same schema. |  |
| &nbsp;`‑c,`<br>`‑‑new‑column`&nbsp; | string | If unifying, add a new column with given name and copying the value of the current input file line. |  |
| &nbsp;`‑‑dry‑run`&nbsp; | string | If set to true (the default for safety reasons), the commands are sent to stdout instead of executing them. If set to a file, the commands will be written to the specified text file instead of executing them. The file is only created after all flag validation succeeds, so a conflicting flag combination will not truncate an existing file. Only if set to false will the commands be actually executed. | `true` |

## Common Options [↩](#nav)

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Type | Description | Default |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| &nbsp;`‑h,`<br>`‑‑help`&nbsp; | flag | Display this message |  |
| &nbsp;`‑n,`<br>`‑‑no‑headers`&nbsp; | flag | When set, the file will be considered to have no headers. |  |
| &nbsp;`‑d,`<br>`‑‑delimiter`&nbsp; | string | The field delimiter for reading CSV data. Must be a single character. (default: ,) |  |
| &nbsp;`‑p,`<br>`‑‑progressbar`&nbsp; | flag | Show progress bars. Not valid for stdin. |  |
