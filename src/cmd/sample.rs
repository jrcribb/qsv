static USAGE: &str = r#"
Randomly samples CSV data.

It supports eight sampling methods:
* RESERVOIR: the default sampling method when NO INDEX is present and no sampling method
  is specified. Visits every CSV record exactly once, using MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
  sample size (k) - O(k).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling

* INDEXED: the default sampling method when an INDEX is present and no sampling method
  is specified. Uses random I/O to sample efficiently, as it only visits records selected
  by random indexing, using MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the sample size (k) - O(k).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access

* BERNOULLI: the sampling method when the --bernoulli option is specified.
  Each record has an independent probability p of being selected, where p is
  specified by the <sample-size> argument. For example, if p=0.1, then each record
  has a 10% chance of being selected, regardless of the other records. The final
  sample size is random and follows a binomial distribution. Uses CONSTANT MEMORY - O(1).
  When sampling from a remote URL, processes the file in chunks without downloading it
  entirely, making it especially efficient for sampling large remote files.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_sampling

* SYSTEMATIC: the sampling method when the --systematic option is specified.
  Selects every nth record from the input, where n is the integer part of <sample-size>
  and the fraction part is the percentage of the population to sample.
  For example, if <sample-size> is 10.5, it will select every 10th record and 50% of the
  population. If <sample-size> is a whole number (no fractional part), it will select
  every nth record for the whole population. Uses CONSTANT memory - O(1). The starting
  point can be specified as "random" or "first". Useful for time series data or when you
  want evenly spaced samples.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_sampling

* STRATIFIED: the sampling method when the --stratified option is specified.
  Stratifies the population by the specified column and then samples from each stratum.
  Particularly useful when a population has distinct subgroups (strata) that are
  heterogeneous within but homogeneous between in terms of the variable of interest. 
  For example, if you want to sample 1,000 records from a population of 100,000 across the US,
  you can stratify the population by US state and then sample 20 records from each stratum.
  This will ensure that you have a representative sample from each of the 50 states.
  The sample size must be a whole number. Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
  number of strata (s) and samples per stratum (k) as specified by <sample-size> - O(s*k).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling

* WEIGHTED: the sampling method when the --weighted option is specified.
  Samples records with probabilities proportional to values in a specified weight column.
  Records with higher weights are more likely to be selected. For example, if you have
  sales data and want to sample transactions weighted by revenue, high-value transactions
  will have a higher chance of being included. Non-numeric weights are treated as zero.
  The weights are automatically normalized using the maximum weight in the dataset.
  Specify the desired sample size with <sample-size>. Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
  sample size (k) - O(k).
  "Weighted random sampling with a reservoir" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2005.11.003

* CLUSTER: the sampling method when the --cluster option is specified.
  Samples entire groups of records together based on a cluster identifier column.
  The number of clusters is specified by the <sample-size> argument.
  Useful when records are naturally grouped (e.g., by household, neighborhood, etc.).
  For example, if you have records grouped by neighborhood and specify a sample size of 10,
  it will randomly select 10 neighborhoods and include ALL records from those neighborhoods
  in the output. This ensures that natural groupings in the data are preserved.
  Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the number of clusters (c) - O(c).
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_sampling

* TIMESERIES: the sampling method when the --timeseries option is specified.
  Samples records based on time intervals from a time-series dataset. Groups records by
  time windows (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) and selects one record per interval.
  Supports adaptive sampling (e.g., prefer business hours or weekends) and aggregation
  (e.g., mean, sum, min, max) within each interval. The starting point can be "first"
  (earliest), "last" (most recent), or "random". Particularly useful for time-series data
  where simple row-based sampling would always return the same records due to sorting.
  Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the number of records - O(n).

Supports sampling from CSVs on remote URLs. Note that the entire file is downloaded first
to a temporary file before sampling begins for all sampling methods except Bernoulli, which
streams the file as it samples it, stopping when the desired sample size is reached or the
end of the file is reached.

Sampling from stdin is also supported for all sampling methods, copying stdin to a in-memory
buffer first before sampling begins.

If a stats cache is available, it will be used to do extra checks on systematic,
weighted and cluster sampling, and to speed up sampling in general.

This command is intended to provide a means to sample from a CSV data set that
is too big to fit into memory (for example, for use with commands like
'qsv stats' with the '--everything' option). 

Examples:

  # Take a sample of 1000 records from data.csv using RESERVOIR or INDEXED sampling
  # depending on whether an INDEX is present. 
  qsv sample 1000 data.csv

  # Take a sample of approximately 10% of the records from data.csv using RESERVOIR
  # or INDEXED sampling depending on whether an INDEX is present.
  qsv sample 0.1 data.csv

  # Take a sample using BERNOULLI sampling where each record has a 5% chance of being selected
  qsv sample --bernoulli 0.05 data.csv

  # Take a sample using SYSTEMATIC sampling where every 10th record is selected
  # and approximately 50% of the population is sampled, starting from a random point.
  qsv sample --systematic random 10.5 data.csv

  # Take a sample using STRATIFIED sampling where 20 records are sampled from each
  # stratum defined by the 'State' column.
  qsv sample --stratified State 20 data.csv

  # Take a sample using WEIGHTED sampling where records are sampled with probabilities
  # proportional to the 'Revenue' column, for a total sample size of 1000 records.
  qsv sample --weighted Revenue 1000 data.csv

  # Take a sample using CLUSTER sampling where 10 clusters defined by the
  # 'Neighborhood' column are randomly selected and all records from those clusters
  # are included in the sample.
  qsv sample --cluster Neighborhood 10 data.csv

Usage:
    qsv sample [options] <sample-size> [<input>]
    qsv sample --help

sample arguments:
    <input>                The CSV file to sample. This can be a local file,
                           stdin, or a URL (http and https schemes supported).

    <sample-size>          When using INDEXED, RESERVOIR or WEIGHTED sampling, the sample size.
                             Can either be a whole number or a value between value between 0 and 1.
                             If a fraction, specifies the sample size as a percentage of the population. 
                             (e.g. 0.15 - 15 percent of the CSV)
                           When using BERNOULLI sampling, the probability of selecting each record
                             (between 0 and 1).
                           When using SYSTEMATIC sampling, the integer part is the interval between
                             records to sample & the fractional part is the percentage of the
                             population to sample. When there is no fractional part, it will
                             select every nth record for the entire population.
                           When using STRATIFIED sampling, the stratum sample size.
                           When using CLUSTER sampling, the number of clusters.
                           When using TIMESERIES sampling, the interval number (treated as hours
                             by default, e.g., 1 = 1 hour). Use --ts-interval for custom intervals
                             like "1d" (daily), "1w" (weekly), "1m" (monthly), "1y" (yearly), etc.                       

sample options:
    --seed <number>        Random Number Generator (RNG) seed.
    --rng <kind>           The Random Number Generator (RNG) algorithm to use.
                           Three RNGs are supported:
                            * standard: Use the standard RNG.
                              1.5 GB/s throughput.
                            * faster: Use faster RNG using the Xoshiro256Plus algorithm.
                              8 GB/s throughput.
                            * cryptosecure: Use cryptographically secure HC128 algorithm.
                              Recommended by eSTREAM (https://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/).
                              2.1 GB/s throughput though slow initialization.
                           [default: standard]

                           SAMPLING METHODS:
    --bernoulli            Use Bernoulli sampling instead of indexed or reservoir sampling.
                           When this flag is set, <sample-size> must be between
                           0 and 1 and represents the probability of selecting each record.
    --systematic <arg>     Use systematic sampling (every nth record as specified by <sample-size>).
                           If <arg> is "random", the starting point is randomly chosen between 0 & n.
                           If <arg> is "first", the starting point is the first record.
                           The sample size must be a whole number. Uses CONSTANT memory - O(1).
    --stratified <col>     Use stratified sampling. The strata column is specified by <col>.
                           Can be either a column name or 0-based column index.
                           The sample size must be a whole number. Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the
                           number of strata (s) and samples per stratum (k) - O(s*k).
    --weighted <col>       Use weighted sampling. The weight column is specified by <col>.
                           Can be either a column name or 0-based column index.
                           The column will be parsed as a number. Records with non-number weights
                           will be skipped.
                           Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the sample size (k) - O(k).
    --cluster <col>        Use cluster sampling. The cluster column is specified by <col>.
                           Can be either a column name or 0-based column index.
                           Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the number of clusters (c) - O(c).
    --timeseries <col>     Use time-series sampling. The time column is specified by <col>.
                           Can be either a column name or 0-based column index.
                           Sorts records by the specified time column and then groups by time intervals
                           and selects one record per interval.
                           Supports various date formats (19 formats recognized by qsv-dateparser).
                           Uses MEMORY PROPORTIONAL to the number of records - O(n).

    --ts-interval <intvl>  Time interval for grouping records. Format: <number><unit>
                           where unit is h (hour), d (day), w (week), m (month), y (year).
                           Examples: "1h", "1d", "1w", "2d" (every 2 days).

                           "both" (combine business-hours and weekends).
    --ts-aggregate <func>  Aggregation function to apply within each time interval.
                           Options: "first", "last", "mean", "sum", "count", "min", "max", "median".

                           Will download the entire file if not specified.
                           If the CSV is partially downloaded, the sample will be taken
                           only from the downloaded portion.
    --force                Do not use stats cache, even if its available.

                           first row is the header row and will always appear
                           in the output.)
    -d, --delimiter <arg>  The field delimiter for reading/writing CSV data.
                           Must be a single character. (default: ,)
